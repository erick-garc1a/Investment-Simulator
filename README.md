# Investment Simulator Game 📈

An interactive educational game that simulates long-term investing using real historical financial data within the video game industry. Players take on the role of investors navigating a simplified market over a 20-year timeline where they are buying and selling stocks based on financial metrics, news events, and market trends. Built for those looking to learn the fundamentals of investing and decision-making with data. We focused solely on the video game industry as different industries respond uniquely to economic cycles, regulatory environments, and market trends. By narrowing the scope players can better understand how financial ratios, company news, and macroeconomic events that influence stock performance without being overwhelmed by cross-industry variability.
